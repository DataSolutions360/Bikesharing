# Bikesharing

## Purpose

The purpose of this activity is to provide investors with data that shows that a bike-sharing program in Des Moined IA is a solid business proposal. In order to solidify this proposal, one of the stakeholders would like to see a complete bike trip analysis. For this chalenge, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" colum from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, with the new DataFrame I:

- Showed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.

- Showed the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.

- Showed the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

This was done via visualizations with Tableau in order for others to better understand the data I present to them.

## Trip Duration becomes a DataFrame for further analysis
